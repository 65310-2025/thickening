We investigated whether thickened origami structures can maintain rigid folding motions using a numerical simulation that combines:

- **Empirical folding limit** (\( n = 0.96 \ln (w/t) \)) to determine if the material can physically fold.
- **Numerical optimization** to check whether fold angles propagate smoothly without self-intersection.

## Summary
1. The empirical limit filters out cases where the material is too thick to fold.
2. Numerical optimization tests if a continuous rigid motion exists.
3. Comparing results reveals cases where foldability exceeds the empirical threshold, suggesting that hinge modifications can extend feasibility.

## Findings
- Some folds pass numerical optimization but fail the empirical limit, indicating that structural modifications like offset creases may allow folding beyond the expected threshold.
- Using both methods provides a more complete approach: empirical filtering ensures material feasibility, while numerical checks confirm geometric validity.
